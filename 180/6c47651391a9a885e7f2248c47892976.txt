				 <h3 class="heading-xs animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".0">Purpose and Use of Tokens in the Platform</h3>
                <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 The purpose of the Tokens is to facilitate use of the related services (collectively, the “Services”) through the Elephant.Mine platform (the “Platform”) created and released by Company. Specifically, Tokens are designed to encourage the fair use of the platform by the users, incentivize users to be honest by IVORYarding truthful behavior, penalize users who submit false reviews or surveys, and incentivize users to engage with one another in a way that will lead to the creation of high quality content. Tokens will be fundamental in the two main business activities, market research and user reviews, which are designed to complement one another with their respective advantages. Besides earning tokens from completing surveys, users can also earn tokens by writing and validating reviews (as defined in the Validation Protocol section of the White Paper). The more activity on the platform may result to more token IVORYards and an improved reputation for the user.
 
                </p>
				
				<p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 As such, the Tokens are intended to facilitate interaction on the Elephant.Mine Platform, which is intended to have the functionality set forth in Schedule 1. Important additional details regarding the Platform, Services, Product, and Company are provided in the White Paper, available at https://Elephant.Mine/static/assets/whitepaper/whitepaper.pdf (the “White Paper”).
 
                </p>
				<p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 The Tokens do not confer any rights other than rights relating to the provision and receipt of Services in the Platform, subject to limitations and conditions in the applicable Platform Terms and Policies (as defined below). In particular, you understand and accept that Tokens do not represent, constitute or confer:
 <ul>
 <li>any ownership right or stake, share, equity, security, bond, debt instrument, or any other financial instrument or investment or investment carrying equivalent rights; </li>
  <li> any right to receive future revenues, shares, intellectual property rights or any other form of participation or governance rights from, in, or relating to the Platform and/or Company and its corporate affiliates, other than the ability to use the Tokens in connection with the Services in the Platform, subject to these Terms;</li>
  <li> any form of money or legal tender in any jurisdiction or any representation of money, including electronic money.</li>
</ul>
  </p>
				<p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 As such, protections offered by applicable law in relation to the acquisition, storage, sale, and/or transfer of the instrument and/or investments of the types referred to above shall not apply to any contribution made under these Terms for the acquisition of Tokens or to your storage, sale, and/or transfer of the Tokens.

                 We make no warranties of title or implied warranties of merchantability of fitness for a particular use with respect to the Tokens or their functionality, features, purpose, or attributes in connection with the Platform. As a result, you may never receive delivery of Tokens, and you may lose the entire amount of the payment you make to the Company.

				<p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">

                 The native token of the Elephant.Mine platform is called an IVORY token. It is a utility token that allows companies to gain access to the market research tools on the platform, and enables users to get IVORYards by answering surveys and generating quality reviews. IVORY is based on the Multichain blockchain. 
 
                </p>
				<p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 The creation and functionality of the IVORY Token is described in the latest version of the White Paper which is published in the Company’s website.

				 <h3 class="heading-xs animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".0">INTENDED FUNCTIONALITY OF IVORY TOKENS ON THE PLATFORM</h3>
                <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 The native token of the Elephant.Mine platform is called an IVORY token. It is a utility token that allows companies to gain access to the tools on the platform, and enables users to get IVORYards by performing mining operations on our platform. IVORY is based on the Multichain blockchain. A separate token is needed to allow for the added layer of community governance and token economics involved in creating the Elephant.Mine platform. The token utility is clear in being an instrument of payment for utility services. A platform-specific token acts as a good representation of the specific concepts used across Elephant.Mine. A concrete example of this is the creation of a IVORY based rewards Pool pre-filled with generated IVORY tokens as a way to jumpstart the platform, or allocating a certain amount of tokens to bounty campaigns and sponsor academic research and non-profit activities.

                </p>
				   <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
The IVORY Token may support, but not be limited to these functionalities, broadly defined as:
<ul>
				<li>Creating market research surveys and funding them with IVORY tokens
 </li>
				<li>Targeting these surveys to users
 </li>
				<li> Users answering the surveys and getting IVORY tokens as a IVORYard
</li>
				<li>Creating reviews and getting IVORY tokens as a IVORYard
 </li>
				<li>Validating reviews and getting IVORY tokens as a IVORYard
 </li>
				
				</ul>

 
                </p>
				   <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 The success of the Platform will depend on the utility of IVORY TOKENS within the Platform. You should not purchase IVORY TOKENS if you do not intend to use them on the Platform for the purposes described in our White Paper.

				  <h3 class="heading-xs animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".0">Risks Connected to The Value of IVORY Tokens</h3>
                <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Rights, Functionality or Features: The IVORY Tokens (Tokens) may only have the rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features, on the Platform or within the Protocol as described in this Whitepaper. Company Parties do not guarantee that the Tokens have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features.


 
                </p>
				<p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Lack of Development of Market for the Tokens: Because there has been no prior public trading market for the Tokens, the Token Sale may not result in an active or liquid market for the Tokens, and their price may be highly volatile. Even if the Tokens are tradable in a secondary market, in practice, there may not be enough active buyers and sellers, or the bid-ask spreads may be too wide. The Token holders may not be able to exit their token holdings easily. In the worst-case scenario where no secondary market develops, a Token holder may not be able to liquidate his/her Token holdings at all. The exchanges or platforms that facilitate secondary trading of the Tokens may not be regulated by any applicable laws.


 
                </p>
				<p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Risks Relating to Highly Speculative Traded Price: The valuation of digital tokens in a secondary market is usually not transparent, and highly speculative. The Tokens do not hold any ownership rights to Company’s assets and, therefore, are not backed by any tangible asset. Traded price of the Tokens can fluctuate greatly within a short period of time. There is a high risk that a token holder could lose his/her entire payment amount. In the worst-case scenario, the Tokens could be rendered worthless.


 
                </p>
				<p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 The Tokens May Have No Value: The Tokens may have no value and there is no guarantee or representation of liquidity for the Tokens. Company is not and shall not be responsible for or liable for the market value of the Tokens, the transferability and/or liquidity of the Tokens and/or the availability of any market for the Tokens through third parties or otherwise.


 
                </p>
				<p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 The Tokens are Non-Refundable: Company is not obliged to provide the token holders with a refund related to the Tokens for any reason, and the token holders will not receive money or other compensation in lieu of the refund. No promises of future performance or price are or will be made in respect to the Tokens, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that the Tokens will hold any particular value. Therefore, the recovery of spent resources may be impossible or may be subject to foreign laws or regulations, which may not be the same as the private law of the token holder.


 
                </p>
				 <h3 class="heading-xs animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".0">Blockchain And Software Risks</h3>
                <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Blockchain Delay Risk: On the Ethereum blockchains, timing of block production is determined by proof of work so block production can occur at random times. For example, the cryptocurrency transferred in the ﬁnal seconds of a distribution period during the Token Presale or the Token Sale may not get included for that period. Buyer acknowledges and understands that the Ethereum blockchain may not include the Buyer’s transaction at the time Buyer expects and Buyer may not receive the Tokens in this regard.

                </p>
				 <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Blockchain Congestion Risk: The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also intentionally spam the respective network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic tokens. Buyer acknowledges and understands that Bitcoin or Ethereum block producers may not include Buyer’s transaction when Buyer wants, or Buyer’s transaction may not be included at all.


 
                </p>
				 <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Risk of Software Weaknesses: The concept of token smart contract which creates the mechanism of creation and distribution of the Tokens (“Tokens Smart Contracts”), the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) are still in an early development stage and unproven. There is no representation and warranty that the process for creating the Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free. There is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of the cryptocurrency and/or the Tokens.


 
                </p>
				 <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Risk of New Technology: The Platform, the Protocol, the Tokens and all of the matters set forth in this Whitepaper are new and untested. The Platform, the Protocol and the Tokens might not be capable of completion, creation, implementation or adoption. It is possible that no blockchain utilizing the Platform or the Protocol will be launched. Even if the Platform and the Protocol are completed, implemented and adopted, it might not function as intended, and any Tokens may not have functionality that is desirable or valuable. Also, technology is changing rapidly, so the Platform, the Protocol and the Tokens may become outdated.


 
                </p>
					 <h3 class="heading-xs animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".0">Security Risks</h3>
                <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Risk of Loss of Private Keys: The Tokens purchased by Buyer may be held by Buyer in Buyer’s digital wallet or vault, which requires a private key, or a combination of private keys, for access. Accordingly, loss of requisite private keys associated with such Buyer’s digital wallet or vault storing the Tokens will result in loss of such Tokens, access to Buyer’s token balance and/or any initial balances in blockchains created by third parties. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private keys, including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault service the buyer uses, may be able to misappropriate the Buyer’s Tokens. Company, members or any related parties are not responsible for any such losses.


 
                </p>
				 <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Lack of the Tokens Security: The Tokens may be subject to expropriation and or/theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Tokens Smart Contracts or the Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurﬁng and spooﬁng. Furthermore, because the Ethereum platform rests on open source software, there is the risk that Ethereum smart contracts may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the Tokens or result in the loss of the Tokens, the loss of ability to access or control the Tokens. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and holders of the Tokens are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.


 
                </p>
				 <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Risk of Ethereum Mining Attacks: The blockchain used for the Tokens Smart Contracts is susceptible to mining attacks, including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, "selﬁsh-mining" attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Tokens Smart Contracts, expected proper execution and sequencing of the Tokens transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.


 
                </p>
				 <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Failure to Map a Public Key to Buyer’s Account: Failure of buyer of the Tokens to map a public key to such buyer’s account may result in third parties being unable to recognize buyer’s Tokens balance on the Ethereum blockchain when and if they conﬁgure the initial balances of a new blockchain based upon the Platform and the Protocol.


 
                </p>
				 <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Risk of Incompatible Wallet Service: The wallet or wallet service provider used for the acquisition and storage of the Tokens has to be technically compatible with the Tokens. The failure to assure this may have the result that buyer of the Tokens will not gain access to his Tokens.


 
                </p>
					 <h3 class="heading-xs animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".0">Risks Relating to The Project Development</h3>
                <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Risk Related to Reliance on Third Parties: The Project may rely, in whole or partly, on third parties to adopt and implement it and to continue to develop, supply, and otherwise support it. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will complete their work, properly carry out their obligations, or otherwise meet anyone’s needs, all of might have a material adverse effect on the Project.


 
                </p>
				  <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Dependence of the Project on Senior Management Team: The ability of the Project team which is responsible for maintaining competitive position of the Project is dependent to a large degree on the services of a respective senior management team. The loss or diminution in the services of members of respective senior management team or an inability to attract, retain and maintain additional senior management personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Project. Competition for personnel with relevant expertise is intense due to the small number of qualiﬁed individuals, and this situation affects the ability to retain its existing senior management and attract additional qualiﬁed senior management personnel, which could have a adverse impact on the Project.


 
                </p>
				  <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Dependence of the Project on Various Factors:The development of the Project may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of further funding beyond the initial funds of EUR 1,000,000, lack of commercial success or prospects.


 
                </p>
				  <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Changes to the Project: The Project is still under development and may undergo changes over time. Although Company Parties intend for the Project to have the features and speciﬁcations set forth in this Whitepaper, changes to such features and speciﬁcations can be made for any number of reasons, any of which may mean that the Project does not meet expectations of buyer of the Tokens.


 
                </p>
				  <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Risk Associated with Other Applications: The Project may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unafﬁliated third parties, under which the Tokens will have no intrinsic utility and value.


 
                </p>
					 <h3 class="heading-xs animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".0">Risks Arising in Course of Company Parties’ Business</h3>
                <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Risk of Conflicts of Interest: Any Company Party may be engaged in transactions with related parties, including respective majority shareholder, companies controlled by him or in which he owns an interest, and other afﬁliates, and may continue to do so in the future. Conflicts of interest may arise between any Company Party's afﬁliates and respective Company Party, potentially resulting in the conclusion of transactions on terms not determined by market forces.


 
                </p>
					 <h3 class="heading-xs animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".0">Governmental Risks</h3>
                <p class="animated" data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay=".2">
                 Uncertain Regulatory Framework: The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets, and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difﬁcult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies. It is likewise difﬁcult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact the Tokens in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that the tokens are regulated ﬁnancial instruments that require registration. Company may cease the distribution of the tokens, the development of the Project or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so.
